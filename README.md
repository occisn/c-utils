# c-utils

Personal utilities for C.

This repository is not supposed to be a .h library, or forked and included in another project. It is more a kind of shelf with available stand-alone functions.

When relevant, functions are illustrated with associated `SHOW-_xxx` functions.

File **integers.c**  
   - functions `lcm__int` and `gcd__int`
   
File **integer_primes.c**  
   - function `largest_prime_factor__uint64`  
   - function `factorize__uint64`   
   - function `is_prime__uint64`  
   - functions `sieve_eratosthenes__simple__uint64` and `sieve_eratosthenes__odd_bit__uint64`  
   - function `list_of_primes_below__uint64`   
   - function `nth_prime__uint64`
      
File **durations.c**  
   - function `measure_duration`
